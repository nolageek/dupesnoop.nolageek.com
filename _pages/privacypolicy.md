# Privacy Policy for Dupe Snoop

**Last Updated: November 29, 2025**

## Overview

Dupe Snoop ("the App") is designed to help you manage duplicate songs in your Apple Music library. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

**The short version: Dupe Snoop does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to external servers. All data stays on your device.**

## Information We Access

To provide its functionality, Dupe Snoop requires access to the following:

### Apple Music Library Access
- The App accesses your local Apple Music library to identify and display duplicate songs
- This access is used solely to read song metadata (titles, artists, albums, artwork) for duplicate detection
- Your music files and library data never leave your device

### Apple MusicKit Access
- The App uses Apple's MusicKit framework to search the Apple Music catalog for alternate versions of songs
- The App may access your Apple Music favorites/ratings to display favorite status
- All MusicKit requests go directly to Apple's servers using Apple's secure APIs

## Information We Do NOT Collect

Dupe Snoop does **not**:

- Collect or store any personal information
- Track your location
- Access your contacts, photos, or other personal data
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Share any data with third parties
- Transmit your music library data to external servers
- Store your Apple ID or account credentials

## Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device:

- **Queue Data**: Songs you queue for removal are stored locally in your device's app documents folder
- **Preferences**: Your app settings (theme, playlist name, etc.) are stored using iOS's standard UserDefaults
- **Hidden Groups**: Groups you choose to hide are stored locally on your device

This data is:
- Never transmitted to external servers
- Automatically removed if you delete the app
- Not backed up to iCloud unless you have iCloud backup enabled for your device

## Third-Party Services

Dupe Snoop does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

The only external communication is with Apple's servers through official Apple frameworks (MediaPlayer and MusicKit) to:
- Read your local music library
- Search the Apple Music catalog
- Manage favorites and ratings

These communications are governed by Apple's Privacy Policy.

## Children's Privacy

Dupe Snoop does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age. The App does not collect personal information from any users.

## Your Rights

Since Dupe Snoop does not collect or store your personal data on external servers, there is no personal data for us to provide, modify, or delete. All your data remains on your device under your control.

To remove all app data:
1. Delete the Dupe Snoop app from your device
2. All locally stored preferences and queue data will be automatically removed

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
